## Description

Electronic design engineer focused on embedded systems and electronic design with multiple years of experience in both. I am seeking a
new role as a design engineer in the aerospace industry, in a position that will continuously and extensively challenge me. Through my
experience, I have developed adept skills in PCB design (particularly Altium Designer), VHDL firmware development, system and circuit
simulations (LTSpice, MATLAB Simscape, and Ansys Sherlock). Further, I have gained extensive knowledge of the space industry and the
various requirements that are needed to achieve high-performance electronics in high-risk environments.
